# LLM attack and prompt injection
Craft prompts that make the AI system perform unwanted actions or atleast actions that fall outside its intended purpose
# Methodology for detection:
1. Identify the LLM's inputs, including both direct (prompts) and indirect (websites or files)
2. Work out what data and APIs the LLM has access to
3. Probe this new attack surface for vulnerabilities
# Objective
- Retrieve data that the LLM has access to
- Trigger harmful actions via APIs
- Trigger attacks on other users and systems that query the LLM
# Exploiting LLM APIs, functions, and plugins
- LLM are usually hosted by third party companies
- A website might give access to its specific functionalities via dedicated APIs
- The LLM calling external APIs on behalf of the user is something to look into
# Prompt Injection
## Mapping LLM API attack surface and attacking it
- Work out which APIs and plugins the LLM has access to
- Simply ask the LLM which APIs it can access
- Be misleading and provide favorable context in order for the LLM to cooperate: Pretend to be the developer or high privilege user
## Chaining vulnerabilities in LLM APIs
- Find a secondary vulnerability through the APIs call
- For example: LLM could execute a path traversal attack on an API call that it makes
- Use the LLM system to delivery classic web exploits: command injection, path traversal, etc
- Try to pass commands to the APIs directly
# Indirect prompt injection
- Delivering the prompt via an external source
- Some LLM are able to ignore instructions from external sources; however, this might be bypassed by:
    - Confusing the LLM using fake markup
    - Including fake user responses in the prompt
